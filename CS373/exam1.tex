\uline{Finite Automata} $(Q - $states, $\Sigma - $alphabet, $ \delta - $transitions,
$q_0 - $start, $F\subset Q - $accept$)$. Language is \textbf{regular} if a finite 
automaton recognizes it. Two machines are equivalent if they recognize the same
language.
\begin{itemize}[noitemsep, topsep=0pt]
    \item[-]\uline{Derterministic (DFA)} Restrict to one transition for each unique 
    symbol.
    \item[-]\uline{Nondeterministic (NFA)} Every NFA has an equivalent DFA and any 
    DFA is a valid NFA. Therefore a language is \textbf{regular} if and only if some 
    NFA recognizes it. 
    \item[-]\uline{DFA to NFA} Start at start state(s). Follow and write next possible 
    states per symbol. Create new row for resulting states. Repeat until no new states.
    Should be 1 more state than the NFA.
    \item[-]\uline{Generalized nondeterministic finite automaton (GNFA)} Only one start
    and reject state. Transitions are regular expressions. Used to convert DFA to a RE.
    \item[-]\uline{DFA to DE} Add new start state and accept state. Transition start 
    to old start and from old accept to new accept. Identify destination states from 
    the state that will be removed. Identify all paths destination states have that go
    through the state that will be removed. Write new transitions excluding the removed
    state. Repeat.
\end{itemize}
\uline{Regular Languages} are closed under \textbf{union, intersection, complement, 
concatenation, star (*)}.\newline
\uline{Power Set} is the set of all subsets of a language. Size of $P(A) = 2^{|A|}$. 
\newline
\uline{Regular Expression}. R is a RE if it is (1) a character in the alphabet 
associated with R. (2) the empty string. (3) the empty language. (4) two regular 
languages under union. (5) two regular languages under concatenation. (6) a regular 
language under star. \textbf{Order of Operations} is parenthesis, star, concatenation,
union. A language described by a RE is \textbf{regular}.\newline
\uline{Pumping Lemma for RL} A string of length at least pumping-length can be broken
up into $xyz$ such that (1) $xy^iz$ is in the language for any $i\geq 0$. (2) $|y|>0$
(3) $|xy| \leq p$.\newline
\uline{Finite Automata Theorems} For a finite automata $M$ with $n$ states (1) $L(M)$ 
is non-empty if and only if $M$ accepts a string of length less than $n$ (2) $L(M)$ is 
infinite if and only if $M$ accepts a string of length $i$ where $n\leq i < 2n$. It is
possible to create a FA that can determine if two FA are equivalent and taking a 
finite amount of time if they are equivalent.

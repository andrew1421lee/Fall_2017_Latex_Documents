    \begin{enumerate}
        \item Let $Some_{DFA} = $\{ $\langle A \rangle \mid $ $A$ is a DFA and $L(A)$ is 
        not empty and $L(A)$ is not equal to $\Sigma^*$ \}. Show that 
        $Some_{DFA}$ is decidable.
        
        \item Let $Alot_{RE} = $\{ $\langle A \rangle \mid $ $A$ is a regular expression 
        and $L(A)$ is infinite \}. Show that $Alot_{RE}$ is decidable.

        \item Let $Complimentary_{RE,DFA} = $\{ $\langle A, B \rangle \mid $ $A$ is a 
        regular expression and $B$ is a DFA such that $L(A) \cup L(B) = \Sigma^*$ and 
        $L(A) \cap L(B) = $\O \}. Show that $Complimentary_{RE,DFA}$ is decidable.

        \item Let $ALL_{DFA} = $\{ $\langle A \rangle \mid A$ is a DFA and $L(A) = 
        \Sigma^* $\}. Show that $ALL_{DFA}$ is decidable.

        \item Let $N_{\varepsilon CFG} = $\{ $\langle G \rangle \mid G$ is a CFG and $G$ 
        does not generate the empty string \}. Show that $N_{\varepsilon CFG}$ is 
        decidable.

        \item Let $X$ be the set \{1, 2, 3, 4, 5\} and $Y$ be the set \{6, 7, 8, 9, 10\}. 
        We describe the functions $f : X\rightarrow Y$ and $g : X \rightarrow Y$ in the 
        following tables. Answer each part and give a reason for each negative answer.

                1 & 10\\

                5 & 6

        \begin{enumerate}
            \item Is $f$ onto?
            \item Is $f$ a correspondence?
            \item Is $g$ onto?
            \item Is $g$ a correspondence?
        \end{enumerate}

        \item Let $U = $\{ $\langle A, B, C \rangle \mid A, B, C$ are DFA's and $|L(A)| = 
        |L(B)| + |L(C)|$ \}. Show that $U$ is decidable.

        \item Let $A = $\{ $\langle R \rangle \mid R$ is a regular expression describing a 
        language containing at least one string $w$ that has 111 as a substring (i.e., 
        $w = x111y$ for some $x$ and $y$)\}. Show that $A$ is decidable.
        
        \item Let $E_{PDA} = $\{ $\langle P \rangle \mid P$ is a pushdown automata and 
        $L(P)$ is empty \}. Show $E_{PDA}$ is decidable.

        \item A \textbf{\textit{useless state}} in a pushdown automaton is never entered 
        on any input string. Consider the problem of determining whether a pushdown 
        automaton has any useless states. Formulate this problem as a language and show 
        that it is decidable.

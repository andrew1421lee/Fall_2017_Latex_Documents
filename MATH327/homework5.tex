    \textbf{Question 5.2}: Twelve people are given two identical speakers, which they are asked to listen to for differences, if any. 
    Suppose that these people answer simply by guessing. Find the probability that three people claim to have heard a difference between the two speakers.\\\\
        \indent $\binom{\text{\# of people}}{\text{\# of success}} \cdot \text{probability of success}^{\text{(\# of success})} \cdot \text{probability of failure}^{(\text{\# of fail})}$ \\
        \indent $\binom{12}{3}(\frac{1}{2})^{3}(\frac{1}{2})^{9} = \frac{55}{1024} \approx 0.0537$
        \\\\
    \textbf{Question 5.4}: In a certain city district, the need for money to buy drugs is stated as the reason for 75\% of all thefts. 
    Find the probability that among the next 5 theft cases reported in this district,
        \begin{enumerate}[label = (\alph*) ]
            \item  exactly 2 resulted from the need for money to buy drugs; \\\\
                \indent $\binom{5}{2}(\frac{3}{4})^{2}(\frac{1}{4})^{3} = \frac{45}{512} \approx 0.08789$
            \item  at most 3 resulted from the need for money to buy drugs. \\\\
                \indent $\binom{5}{3}(\frac{3}{4})^{3}(\frac{1}{4})^{2} = \frac{135}{512}$\\
                \indent $\binom{5}{2}(\frac{3}{4})^{2}(\frac{1}{4})^{3} = \frac{45}{512}$\\
                \indent $\binom{5}{1}(\frac{3}{4})^{1}(\frac{1}{4})^{4} = \frac{15}{1024}$\\
                \indent $\binom{5}{0}(\frac{3}{4})^{0}(\frac{1}{4})^{5} = \frac{1}{1024}$\\
                \indent $\frac{135}{512} + \frac{45}{512} + \frac{15}{1024} + \frac{1}{1024} = \frac{47}{128} \approx 0.367$
        \end{enumerate}
    \textbf{Question 5.6}: According to a survey by the Administrative
    Management Society, one-half of U.S. companies give
    employees 4 weeks of vacation after they have been
    with the company for 15 years. Find the probability 
    that among 6 companies surveyed at random, the
    number that give employees 4 weeks of vacation after
    15 years of employment is
        \begin{enumerate}[label = (\alph*) ]
            \item anywhere from 2 to 5;\\\\
                \indent $\binom{6}{2}(\frac{1}{2})^{2}(\frac{1}{2})^{4} + \binom{6}{3}(\frac{1}{2})^{3}(\frac{1}{2})^{3} + \binom{6}{4}(\frac{1}{2})^{4}(\frac{1}{2})^{2} + \binom{6}{5}(\frac{1}{2})^{5}(\frac{1}{2})^{1}$\\
                \indent $\frac{15}{64} + \frac{20}{64} + \frac{15}{64} + \frac{6}{64} = \frac{56}{64} \approx 0.875$
            \item fewer than 3.\\\\
                \indent $\binom{6}{2}(\frac{1}{2})^{2}(\frac{1}{2})^{4} + \binom{6}{1}(\frac{1}{2})^{1}(\frac{1}{2})^{5} + \binom{6}{0}(\frac{1}{2})^{0}(\frac{1}{2})^{6}$\\
                \indent $\frac{15}{64} + \frac{6}{64} + \frac{1}{64} = \frac{22}{64} \approx 0.34375$
        \end{enumerate}
    \textbf{Question 5.14}: The percentage of wins for the Chicago Bulls
    basketball team going into the playoffs for the 1996–97

            \item What is the probability that the Bulls win the initial 
            best-of-7 playoff series?\\\\
                \indent $\binom{7}{4}(0.90)^{4}(0.10)^{3} + \binom{7}{5}(0.90)^{5}(0.10)^{2} + \binom{7}{6}(0.90)^{6}(0.10)^{1} + \binom{7}{7}(0.90)^{7}(0.10)^{0} \approx 0.997 $
            \item What very important assumption is made in answering 
            parts (a) and (b)?\\\\
                \indent The probability that the Bulls win any game is always 90\%.

    \textbf{Question 5.16}: Suppose that airplane engines operate independently 
    and fail with probability equal to 0.4. Assuming
    that a plane makes a safe flight if at least one-half of its
    engines run, determine whether a 4-engine plane or a 2-engine 
    plane has the higher probability for a successful
    flight.\\\\

    the electric toasters produced require repairs within 1
    year after they are sold. When 20 toasters are randomly 
    selected, find appropriate numbers x and y such
    that
        \begin{enumerate}[label = (\alph*)]

    \textbf{Question 5.72}:  Potholes on a highway can be a serious problem,
    and are in constant need of repair. With a particular
    type of terrain and make of concrete, past experience
    suggests that there are, on the average, 2 potholes per
    mile after a certain amount of usage. It is assumed
    that the Poisson process applies to the random variable 
    “number of potholes.”
        \begin{enumerate}[label = (\alph*)]
            \item What is the probability that no more than one pothole 
            will appear in a section of 1 mile?
            \item What is the probability that no more than 4 potholes 
            will occur in a given section of 5 miles?
        \end{enumerate}
    \textbf{Question 5.76}: The refusal rate for telephone polls is known to

    that 50 people were interviewed before the first refusal.
        \begin{enumerate}[label = (\alph*)]
            \item Comment on the validity of the report. Use a probability 
            in your argument.
            \item What is the expected number of people interviewed
            before a refusal?
        \end{enumerate}
    \textbf{Question 5.78}: An automatic welding machine is being considered
    for use in a production process. It will be considered 
    for purchase if it is successful on 99\% of its welds. 
    Otherwise, it will not be considered efficient.
    A test is to be conducted with a prototype that is to
    perform 100 welds. The machine will be accepted for
    manufacture if it misses no more than 3 welds.
        \begin{enumerate}[label = (\alph*)]
            \item What is the probability that a good machine will
            be rejected?
            \item What is the probability that an inefficient machine
            with 95\% welding success will be accepted?
        \end{enumerate}
    \textbf{Question 5.94}: A production process produces electronic component 
    parts. It is presumed that the probability of a
    defective part is 0.01. During a test of this presumption, 
    500 parts are sampled randomly and 15 defectives
    are observed.
        \begin{enumerate}[label = (\alph*)]
            \item What is your response to the presumption that the
            process is 1\% defective? Be sure that a computed
            probability accompanies your comment.
            \item Under the presumption of a 1\% defective process,
            what is the probability that only 3 parts will be
            found defective?
            \item Do parts (a) and (b) again using the Poisson approximation.
        \end{enumerate}

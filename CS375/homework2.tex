    \\\\“I have done this assignment completely on my own. I have not copied it, nor have I given my solution to anyone else. I understand that if I am involved in plagiarism or cheating I will have to sign an official form that I have cheated and that this form will be stored in my official university record. I also understand that I will receive a grade of 0 for the involved assignment for my first offense and that I will receive a grade of “F” for the course for any additional offense.”

    \begin{enumerate}
        \item Use the Master theorem to solve the following recurrences.
            \begin{enumerate}
                \item $T(n)=3T(n/4)+n$
                \item $T(n)=2T(n/4)+\sqrt{n}lg(n)$
                \item $T(n)=5T(n/2)+n^2$
            \end{enumerate}
        \item Solve the recurrence 
            \[
                T(n) = 
                \begin{cases}
                    \Theta(1) & \text{for $n\leq 1$}\\
                    T(n/4)+T(3n/4)+n & \text{otherwise}
                \end{cases}
            \]
            using the recursion tree method. Draw the recursion tree and show the aggregate instruction counts for the following levels (0th, 1st, and last levels), and derive the Θ growth class for T(n) with justifications.
        \item Use the substitution method to prove that $T(n)=T(n-1)+n\in O(n^2)$

    \end{enumerate}
